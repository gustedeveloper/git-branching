Chapter 4: The Summit of Destinygit 
Ascending the treacherous Crystal Peaks, Elara collects each Elemental Crystal, feeling the weight of destiny in her hands. At the summit, a gust of wind swirls around her as she arranges the crystals in an ancient pattern. A radiant glow emanates, and with a whispered incantation, Elara channels their combined power.
A dazzling display of light bursts forth, illuminating the darkened peaks. The encroaching shadows retreat, unable to withstand the brilliance of Eldoria's true magic. In this celestial moment, Elara stands victorious, the restored glow of the Elemental Crystals signaling the triumph of light over darkness in the medieval realm.
